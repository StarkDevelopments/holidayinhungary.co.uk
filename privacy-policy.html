        <div class="col-lg-6">
				<p class="lead"><strong>Privacy matters but it can be confusing. This page explains our approach to privacy and how it affects you.</strong></p>
				
				<p><strong>Short version</strong></p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed.</li>
					<li>Some 3rd parties like Facebook and Twitter may know you visited this website, if you use their services. We can’t control them but we don’t believe this knowledge poses any threat to you.</li>
					<li>If you sign up with us we take great care to keep your information safe and we’ll never share it with others without your express permission.</li>
					<li>We never share your data with 3rd parties except to help us deliver our own services.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These are just the key points. If you need detail, keep reading.</p>

				<br />				
				<p><strong>Measuring our visitors</strong></p>
				<p>We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.</p>
				<p>The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.</p>
				<p>You can learn more about <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">Google Analytics</a> or <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">opt out if you wish.</a></p>

				<br />
				<p><strong>If you sign up for a service</strong></p>
				<p>When you sign up for any of our services – paid or otherwise – we will record specific personal information about you, such as your name and email address.</p>
				<p>We will also collect and store information about your use of our services so as to improve them. For example, we keep a log of what features are being used at any time.</p>
				<p>We also log account and transaction history for accounting purposes, and to monitor our business activities.</p>

				<br />				
				<p><strong>Emails</strong></p>
				<p>We may send you email notifications regarding your service (such as invoices) or which you have specifically requested (such as newsletters or notifications when a report is completed). You have the ability to opt out of any of this communication at any time.</p>				
				<p>We will never provide your personal information or email address to any third parties except where they are specifically employed to help deliver our own services, as detailed above.</p>

				<br />				
				<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
				<p>We take many precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. These precautions include:</p>				
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>Use of SSL encryption for sensitive data</li>
					<li>Hardware stored in secured datacentres behind firewalls</li>
					<li>All access to information restricted by password and/or secure key</li>
					<li>Restrictions to what information can be accessed via any location</li>
					<li>Whilst we take great care to ensure any confidential information remains protected we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the Internet.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Of course you are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential. We will ever ask you for your password, so please don’t trust anybody asking you for it.</p>

				<br />				
				<p><strong>Updates to this policy</strong></p>
				<p>We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time, particularly as technology changes. You can always check this page for the latest version. We may also notify you of changes to our privacy policy by email.</p>				

				<br />				
				<p><strong>Any questions?</strong></p>
				<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your personal data, please write to us by email to <a href="mailto:&#98;&#111;&#111;&#107;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#64;&#104;&#111;&#108;&#105;&#100;&#97;&#121;&#105;&#110;&#104;&#117;&#110;&#103;&#97;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#46;&#117;&#107;">booking@holidayinhungary.co.uk</a></p>
